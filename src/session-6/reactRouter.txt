what is routing in website?
-> is basically to navigate from one page to another page in the webpage & we have associate path to follow for navigation.


React routing is special, why?
-> before framework/libraires like react/angular/vue, etc... developers were using php to make web app,
in the web-app every page is different file, so when we travel from one page to another page, the entire webpage get reload

so mordern framework/libraires solve this issue by bringing SPA (Single Page Architecture)


what is SPA (Single Page Architecture)?
-> 1. All pages of website will render on single-page (1 html file) without reloading the webpage.

   2. React will load the different pages of same website according to our navigation, on the same single page (1 html file)
      how? with the help of VDOM and react-reconciliation.

   3. url will show path that we are navigating, but we dont need to reload enitre 
      webpage when we go to another page of same website 

      so how we will achieve that url's path should change according to our navigation but web-app should not refresh?
      -> with the help of React-Router


What is React-Router?
-> 1. it is not the part of react library which is given by Meta(facebook)
   2. it is 3rd party library which is created/maintained by some developers in react community who are not part of META(facebook), 
      to implement the routing functionality in react-app.

what is React-Router package do?
-> it helps to synchronise the react app with browser history-stack
   what does it means?
   -> suppose we have a react-app and we are navigating inside the react app, suppose we want to render previous/forward page 
      that we have visited we use <- / -> button, the data of previous/foward page is given to react by browser history 



How to use React-Router-package?
-> 1. download the package: "npm install react-router-dom" check is it got added on package.json's dependency section
   2. <import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom'> in src/index.js file
   3.  BrowserRouter -> enables routing functionality to entire app (react-app) & also sync browser history to react-app.
   4. create home.jsx/routh.jsx to define all the routes in our react-web-app
