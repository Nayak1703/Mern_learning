What / Why is useRef?
->  1. useRef is react hook which is used in certain functionality we want in our component.
        
    Requirement:
        - When we want to access particular element (jsx/html element) through React, without directly accessing DOM.
        - When we want a variable, & the change of value of the variable should not affect the re-render of the component.
        - When we want a variable, that value of the variable should not get affected by the re-render of the component.


How useRef is used?
->  - import {useRef} from 'react'  -->  import from react 

    - const variable = useRef(initial-value)
        => variable - will store the object.
        => useRef - hook, it returns the object of the single property i.e current.
        => initial-value - any dataType value u can initialy assign to variable. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

    - example:
        const inputRef = useRef(null)  //current value of inputRef is null

        console.log(inputRef)
        =>  {
                current:null
            }
    
    - it is not recommended to use variable of useRef to get display in DOM.

    - if you are storing the elements properties in useRef's variable then, it is not recommended to manipulate the element
      through useRef's variable if our state-variable is manipulating the same element.
