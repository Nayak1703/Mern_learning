Need of Debouncing ?
=>
    1. let consider youtube website, in that we have search-bar, when ever we type somethinf on that search-bar
        it suggest list of video's topic related to the text we have written in search-bar.
        (this suggestion we are getting is with the help of API, API call list from backend every time we are 
        enerting the letter - On-change of the input filed)

    2. suppose i want to see the video on topic "Ramayana",
        i typed R -> a -> m ... so on, every time we write a letter in input filed(search-bar)
        APi get trigger and it will show suggestion.
    
    3. Calling API is heavy duty for website, if our topic name is very big then API will call every single time we add/remove
        the text from Search-bar
    
    4. So there is need to lower the calling of API, means: wait for fixed time, so that user can write something,
        more details about the topic and then call the API.

    5. Again i want to search the name topic of Ramayana, based on fixed timer, i will have written Ramay then API will trigger
        and it will suggest the topic list based on search Ramay, so the count of calling  API will decrease.

    6. So Debouncing is the technique to lower the count of the API calling on trigger on frequent events like typing or scrolling. 
        this will increase website performance
